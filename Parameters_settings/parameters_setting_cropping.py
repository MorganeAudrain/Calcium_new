This script is created for selection a cropping section from the videos and creates new files where only the region of
interest(ROI) is considered.

For testing different parameters in the upcoming parts of the pipeline, cropping parameters can be chosen to select
only a small region, in a way that this will accelerate the time requirements for running different tests.

Once the new cropping parameters are selected, the data base is update. If the cropping parameters are new and had never
been use for a particular mouse, session, trial, resting condition, a new line will be added to the data base and the
cropping version will be the previous maximum plus one. If the parameters where already used, the cropping version will not
be increased, but the cropping files will be rewritten.

Cropping parameters should be always the same for a mouse, so after selection the last part of this script can be use
to set the cropping parameters in the parameters data base for all the sessions and trials of a mouse.
